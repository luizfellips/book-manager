## Book Manager Project
This is a project I am working on to explore Laravel and Vue integrations.
Currently it just supports:

- navigation component(which fetches items from database through a controller returning json response, migration and models are created)
- simple book page listing, which is fetched through controller and renders a Inertia view passing our books all() result there.
- simple about page that has no content at all, just to test routes
